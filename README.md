# Portfolio

## Purpose
I've been building a few projects and need a way to showcase them. The goal of this project is to create a portfolio of my works and also a chance for me to get better with the Next.js framework. 

A link to the hosted portfolio can be found [here](https://emadislamportfolio.vercel.app/).

## Setup
If you wish to make a local clone of this project, within your terminal you will need to run `git clone https://github.com/code-emad/porfolio-ver1.git`.

Once the files have been cloned, you will need to change directory into the project directory and run `npm install` which will install the dependencies listed within the package.json file.

`npm run dev` will allow you to run the app in development mode. Within your browser, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

## Minimum Versions
Node v19.1.0
